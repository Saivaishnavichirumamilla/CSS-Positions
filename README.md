# CSS-Positions
### Created posters using CSS positions and Box model
##### We can create most of the designs if we know well about positions and box model.
In box model, main components are padding, border and margin.
* Padding: Space inside the border
* Margin: Space outside the border

We have four positions mainly: Fixed, Sticky, Relative and Absolute
* Fixed : it's relative to viewport, that element will be fixed in the defined place even if we scroll. Mainly used for navigationbars,fixed headers & footers
* Sticky: It's also similar to fixed, the difference until specific threshold it'll move as we scroll when it reaches the defined threshold value it'll become fixed.
* Relative: This is used for positioning absolute element.
* Absolute: Positioned at specific coordintes relative to relative element.


Note: Some extra points which might be useful while coding CSS
* % is a relative value, it refers to the parent element when used.
